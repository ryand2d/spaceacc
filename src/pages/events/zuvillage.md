## Track designed by sp/acc
sp/acc is a community organizing space acceleration events at Zuzalu events around the world. Zuzalu has already fostered intense collaboration and innovation across its current verticals. Letâ€™s expand past crypto, AI, and biotech to invite one of the most sophisticated and challenging industries in the world to join our community too. Topics include space infrastructure, manufacturing, medicine, travel, defense, policy and economics. We are also experimenting with different formats like debates and hands-on workshops.  We celebrate the boundlessness of space and the infinite spirit of exploration it inspires. In the pursuit of scientific enlightenment and the expansion of human civilization we embrace the unknown with unwavering determination and optimism.  We are laying the foundations for a multi-planetary society by educating entrepreneurs, co-creating policies, and cross-pollinating in the Zuzalu community.
